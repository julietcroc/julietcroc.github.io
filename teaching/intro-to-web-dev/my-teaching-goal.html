    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Hello Designers to Be!&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">I am your instructor for this class, Juliet Crocco. My goal for this course is to help you learn enough about web development and HTML and CSS that you feel comfortable saying that you can hand-code a website using HTML and CSS and you are ready for learning JavaScript. If you do not need to take JavaScript, then I hope that you feel comfortable telling future employers that you can edit their websites that use HTML and CSS and you can read HTML and CSS code enough to understand what it is doing as a visual on a webpage.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">This course has been redesigned from using a textbook to this version which is called an OER (Open Educational Resource) course. That means that we are using materials from different developers and resources all over the web that allow for sharing of content.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">The web is a very open environment. Since its early beginnings the web has been about openly sharing information. Therefore, learning how to use it and create in it is also just as open. Textbooks are awesome, don't get me wrong. They are super comprehensive and ideally will have everything you need in one place, however, in today's society, the Internet and the technology behind it are still changing all the time. Textbooks cannot keep up with those changes, so relying on industry standard information from current web developers like the stuff found on MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) Web Docs, is really helpful.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">My hope is that as much as you learn skills in coding in this class, you will also learn how to find what you need online. You will need to be able to figure stuff out on your own. So, before asking for my help, do a <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing search</a> (yes, I did just say Bing).&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Bing now has Chat GPT integrated into it so that you can get really comprehensive help and ask follow up questions right in the search engine.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">However, while you have me, ask away! Don't wait until you are completely drained from trying to figure something out, like Lisa:&nbsp;</p>

        <figcaption><em>Beloved Lisa Simpson from the iconic American animated sitcom, created by Matt Groening. A known perfectionist, we see her losing her mind slowly after a mental struggle. Maybe could have asked for help... or not, who would have been able to help her? She was a genius in a crazy family. I digress.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">The point is....</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">When you are freaking out trying to do that thing that you want your code to do and have watched all the videos and searched the internet:&nbsp;</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">There is no need to struggle on your own, you paid for this class, so use the resources of which I include myself as.</p>
