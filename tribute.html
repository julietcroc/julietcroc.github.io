            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Universal Design in regards to accessibility goes beyond the concept of "plain accessibility" by emphasizing a broader and more comprehensive approach to making environments, products, and services usable for everyone. While accessibility focuses on removing barriers and providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities, universal design takes into account the diverse needs and preferences of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.</p>

            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>Universal Design in regards to usability expands upon the concept of usability by considering the needs and preferences of a diverse range of users. While usability focuses on optimizing the user experience for a specific target audience or user group, universal design aims to make the user experience accessible and enjoyable for a wider range of individuals, including those with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and preferences.</p>
