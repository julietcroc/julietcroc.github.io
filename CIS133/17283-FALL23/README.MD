It is really important that you do not make changes in other people's files. 
One of the great things about Github is that any time you do want to make changes, you have to first commit those changes. In this way your identity is recorded. 
Also, if the owner of the file did not want your changes, they can revert to previous versions. This is the beauty of version control.
